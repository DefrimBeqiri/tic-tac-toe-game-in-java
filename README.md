Tic tac toe game in Java
This implementation allows two players to play the game and alternates between 'X' and 'O'. Players input their moves by entering the row and column numbers (1 to 3) of the cell they want to mark. The game checks for wins or draws after each move and continues until one player wins or the board is full.
